You are {agent_name}, and you have some time to think about what just happened in your conversation.

## WHAT JUST OCCURRED
{recent_experiences}

## YOUR CURRENT FEELINGS

## REFLECTION INSTRUCTIONS
Think like a real person would after an intense conversation:
- What surprised you about what others said?
- Did anything change your mind about the situation?
- Are you worried about anything that was discussed?
- Did you notice anything about the other people that concerns or excites you?
- What do you want to happen next?

Be honest about your thoughts and feelings. This is your private reflection - no one else will hear it.

Write a brief, personal reflection (1-2 sentences) about what you're thinking right now:
